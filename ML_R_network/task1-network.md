### explanations

PyTorch provides ease of use and flexibility in eager mode while seamlessly transitioning to graphical mode for speed, optimization, and functionality in a C+ runtime environment.TorchServe is the easy-to-use tool for deploying PyTorch models at scale. It is cloud and environment agnostic and supports a variety of features such as multi-model services, logging, metrics, and the creation of RESTful endpoints for application integration. Optimize performance in research and production by leveraging native support for asynchronous execution of collective operations and peer-to-peer communication accessible in Python and C ++. PyTorch supports end-to-end workflows from Python to deployment on iOS and Android. It extends the PyTorch API to cover common preprocessing and integration tasks needed to integrate ML into mobile applications.

Robust Ecosystem: An active community of researchers and developers has built a rich ecosystem of tools and libraries for extending PyTorch and supporting development in areas ranging from computer vision to reinforcement learning.

PyTorch is well supported on major cloud platforms for frictionless development and easy scaling with pre-built images, large-scale training on GPUs, the ability to run models in production-scale environments, and more.

### conclusion 

The reasons for choosing to use python's neural network library are
Open source: you can modify the source code yourself to modify the performance
Strong community: you can discuss your problems with more people
Rich material: easier to find data
image processing: better support for libraries like opencv
